# Ihellmasker discontinued development of this overlay. I really liked the general look and features like discord push and streamer mode, so I decided to at least update it for 5.0

# Ihm's FFXIV Parser Skin

This is a skin for use with the Advanced Combat Tracker OverlayPlugin. This originally started with the [FF XIV-like skin](https://github.com/Ferlow/FFXIVParserSkin), 
but since I am personally using [Skotlex's Material UI](https://github.com/skotlex/ffxiv-material-ui), I've created this alternative skin.

Both versions will soon be merged and will support adhoc skin swapping.


### Important - [Tested with OverlayPlugin 0.19.4 from the ACT Plugin Browser](https://github.com/OverlayPlugin/OverlayPlugin/releases/tag/v0.19.4)
* Other versions are not supported and might cause issues.

## Roadmap

* Multi-skin (FF XIV-like) [Version 2]
* How-To and screenshot update [Version 2]
* Custom CSS and skinning options [Version 3+]
* Optimisations [Version 1+]
* Possible FF Logs integrations / character lookups / at least a linking feature [Version 3+]

## How to use the skin

### The easy way

To use the skin, no download is needed. Simply use the url below as your parsers URL in the OverlayPlugin settings ,and you're good to go. This also means the skin will automatically be updated with any changes made!

### The hard way

If you really want to, you can download a copy of the layout completely or clone this repo and then use it locally, but you're on your own for that!
