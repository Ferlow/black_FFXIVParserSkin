# Ihellmasker discontinued development of this overlay. I really liked the general look and features like discord push and streamer mode, so I decided to at least update it for 5.0

## For the FF14-like skin see [here](https://github.com/Ferlow/FFXIVParserSkin)

# Ihm's FFXIV Parser Skin

This is a skin for use with RainbowMage's ACT OverlayPlugin, for making your parses look a little more interesting.

The design for this is made to closely resemble the in-game interface.

### Important - OverlayPlugin 0.3.3.11 Required! | The OverlayPlugin fork from Hibyasleep is recommended.

If you're using an older version, your settings will not be saved. To easily identify if you're on this version, just check the overlay configuration window in ACT, you should see 3 buttons labeled `Copy`, `Open DevTools` and, `Reload`, if you do then you're fine, if not then get the [latest version here](https://github.com/hibiyasleep/OverlayPlugin/releases/tag/0.3.3.11).

## Roadmap

The initial goal of this fork was the support of the new 5.0 classes Gunbreaker and Dancer, but also the new DPS thresholds caused some troubles.
I've found it interesting to work on this and optimise and adjust it to my own personal needs.
Planned features/changes currently are:

* Custom CSS and skinning options
* optimisations 
* possible FF Logs integrations / character lookups


## How to use the skin

### The easy way

To use the skin, no download is needed. Simply use the url below as your parsers URL in the OverlayPlugin settings and you're good to go. This also means the skin will automatically be updated with any changes made!

### The hard way

If you really want to, you can download a copy of the layout completely or clone this repo and then use it locally, but you're on your own for that!
